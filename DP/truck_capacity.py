# Mr. Rao is relocating from place A to B. The moving truck has a maximum capacity C. There are ‘N’ items in the house where each item has a corresponding value (Vi) and weight(Wi). Mr. Rao has to carry only the most valuable items whose total weight does not exceed the capacity of truck. The task here is to find those items (single or combination of items) whose total value (v) will be the maximum and their corresponding weight(w) will not exceed truck capacity(c). Here,

# N= No. of items
# C= Maximum capacity of the truck, an integer value,
# W[0 to N-1]- An array consisting weight of each item
# V[0 to N-1] – An array consisting value of each item.
# Example 1:

# Input :

# 4  -> Value of N
# 80 -> Value of C
# [10,45,60,90] -> Elements of array v[], where each element is separated by new line.
# [15,20,30,40] -> Elements of array  w[], where each element is separated by new line.
# Output: 150

# Explanation:

# Value=10 weight=15
# Value=45 weight = 20
# Value = 60 weight=30
# Value=90 weight=40
# The subsets that can  be formed from the array V[], their corresponding weight W[] and comparison with c=80
