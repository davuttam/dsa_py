# The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

# You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

# For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

# Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.
